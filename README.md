# The Problem:
Breaking into the tech industry is hard — not just in terms of learning technical skills, but also in finding where you belong. Whether someone is coming from a coding bootcamp or a traditional university, many entry-level tech enthusiasts feel lost trying to find their niche, build a supportive network, and gain real-world experience.

There’s a gap in how new tech professionals connect with others, access relevant guidance, and grow confidently in their careers. Too often, they feel isolated or unsure of their next steps.

# Our Solution: 
Our team wants to build an inclusive platform that empowers anyone to enter the tech industry — regardless of their background — and find their place. Our app will support users throughout their journey by providing career development tools, a strong community, and opportunities to connect with mentors and peers who can guide them along the way.

This leads us to our user stories, which reflect the diverse types of users we aim to support:

### User Story 1: Technical Bootcamp Participant
As a participant in a tech bootcamp, I want an application that supports me as I progress in my career, so that I can find my community in the tech space.

### User Story 2: University Student
As a university student pursuing a STEM degree, I want an application that helps me understand core engineering concepts, so that I can excel in my academic career. 

### User Story 3: Subject Matter Expert (SME)
As an expert in the technical field, I want to connect with potential junior techies, so that I can provide them with guidance on how they can find their niche
